THE SOLID STATEFrom our earlier studies, we know that liquids and gasesare called fluids because of their ability to flow. Thefluidity in both of these states is due to the fact that themolecules are free to move about. On the contrary, theconstituent particles in solids have fixed positions andcan only oscillate about their mean positions. Thisexplains the rigidity in solids. These properties dependupon the nature of constituent particles and the bindingforces operating between them. The correlation betweenstructure and properties helps in the discovery of newsolid materials with desired properties. For example,carbon nanotubes are new materials that have potentialto provide material that are tougher than steel, lighterthan aluminium and have more conductive property thancopper. Such materials may play an expanding role infuture development of science and society. Some othermaterials which are expected to play an important rolein future are high temperature superconductors,magnetic materials, biodegradable polymers forpackaging, biocompliant solids for surgical implants, etc.Thus, the study of this state becomes more important inthe present scenario.In this Unit, we shall discuss different possiblearrangements of particles resulting in several types ofstructures and explore why different arrangements ofstructural units lend different properties to solids. Wewill also learn how these properties get modified due tothe structural imperfections or by the presence ofimpurities in minute amounts.
