SETS

 .  Introduction
The concept of set serves as a fundamental part of the
present day mathematics. Today this concept is being used
in almost every branch of mathematics. Sets are used to
define the concepts of relations and functions. The study of
geometry, sequences, probability, etc. requires the knowledge
of sets.
The theory of sets was developed by German
mathematician Georg Cantor ( 845- 9 8). He first
encountered sets while working on “problems on trigonometric
series”. In this Chapter, we discuss some basic definitions
and operations involving sets.
 .2 Sets and their Representations
In everyday life, we often speak of collections of objects of a particular kind, such as,
a pack of cards, a crowd of people, a cricket team, etc. In mathematics also, we come
across collections, for example, of natural numbers, points, prime numbers, etc. More
specially, we examine the following collections:
(i) Odd natural numbers less than   , i.e.,  , 3, 5, 7, 9
(ii) The rivers of India
(iii) The vowels in the English alphabet, namely, a, e, i, o, u
(iv) Various kinds of triangles
(v) Prime factors of 2  , namely, 2,3,5 and 7
(vi) The solution of the equation: x
2 – 5x + 6 =  , viz, 2 and 3.
We note that each of the above example is a well-defined collection of objects in
