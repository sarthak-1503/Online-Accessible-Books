THE SOLID STATE
From our earlier studies, we know that liquids and gases
are called fluids because of their ability to flow. The
fluidity in both of these states is due to the fact that the
molecules are free to move about. On the contrary, the
constituent particles in solids have fixed positions and
can only oscillate about their mean positions. This
explains the rigidity in solids. These properties depend
upon the nature of constituent particles and the binding
forces operating between them. The correlation between
structure and properties helps in the discovery of new
solid materials with desired properties. For example,
carbon nanotubes are new materials that have potential
to provide material that are tougher than steel, lighter
than aluminium and have more conductive property than
copper. Such materials may play an expanding role in
future development of science and society. Some other
materials which are expected to play an important role
in future are high temperature superconductors,
magnetic materials, biodegradable polymers for
packaging, biocompliant solids for surgical implants, etc.
Thus, the study of this state becomes more important in
the present scenario.
In this Unit, we shall discuss different possible
arrangements of particles resulting in several types of
structures and explore why different arrangements of
structural units lend different properties to solids. We
will also learn how these properties get modified due to
the structural imperfections or by the presence of
impurities in minute amounts.
